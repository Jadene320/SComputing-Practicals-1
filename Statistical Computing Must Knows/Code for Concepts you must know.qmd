    -   bias, variance, standard error

    -   sampling distribution

    -   different ways to estimate parameters

    -   statistical models (how to fit, interpret, predict)

    -   confidence intervals vs prediction intervals

    -   coverage of confidence intervals

    -   power

    -   principles of the Bayesian approach for statistical modelling (e.g., what is a posterior distribution)
